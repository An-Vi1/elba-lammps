*** Protocol to obtain membrane profiles ***

The followig protocol is based on the scripts in elba-lammps/tools. 
You can simply copy all the tools in the working directory, or you can 
add elba-lammps/tools to your path, or you can call the tools with:
$ python PATH-TO-ELBA-LAMMPS-TOOLS/tool.py input.

- Run the 'bilayer_128dopc4232wat' example. This will generate various
  	'.zProfile' files which can be postprocessed as described in the
	following steps. 
- Run edp.sh tool to obtain electron density profiles (edp*.dat). You
	can then visualize the curves with, e.g., Grace: xmgrace edp*
- Run epp.sh tool to obtain electron potential profiles (epp*.dat). Ditto
	re visualization. 
- Run stress2press.py tool to obtain lateral pressure profile (lpp.dat).
	As explained in the comments at the top of 'stress2press.py', 
	you need to supply an input file (in this case 'stress.zProfile')
	and a value for the interfacial area (typically this can be 
	obtained as lipidArea * numberOfLipidsPerLeaflet).

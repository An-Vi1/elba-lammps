Multibilayers: when generating the "data.*" file, make sure 
	that no atom is outside the box edges. This can happen especially
	with low water content (lipid headgroups can "stick out" of the box).
	In problematic cases, it is possible to generate an initial
	structure with Brahms from scratch, as this will ensure that all
	lipid atoms are within the box edges (at least initially).

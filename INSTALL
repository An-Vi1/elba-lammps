Detailed information on how to build LAMMPS can be found on the official
website (http://lammps.sandia.gov). Before trying to run ELBA, please
read the official LAMMPS compilation instructions, and check that your 
LAMMPS installation can reproduce the official LAMMPS example simulations. 

To run the ELBA model, you have at least two options:

1) Use the "Pre-built Ubuntu Linux executables" 
   (http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html#ubuntu)
   The corresponding executable "lammps-daily" is built with everything 
   needed, so you can run ELBA straight away.

2) Download and extract a LAMMPS tarball 
   (http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html#tar)
   This gives you the flexibility to include/exclude packages, and modify
   the source code. However, to be able to run ELBA, you need to:
      i) Go to the source (src/) directory:
      $ cd lammps-DDMMMYY/src 
      ii) Load these additional packages:
      $ make yes-dipole yes-user-misc
      iii) Compile/recompile with
      $ make mpi
